# Feedback from Code Review

Hello fellow coders!

I've successfully completed a code review meeting and received valuable feedback from **Amal Shehu**. Here's how I tackled it:

## Before Code Review
  - The reviewed problem was [HackerRank in a String!](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/hackerrank-in-a-string/problem?isFullScreen=true)  
  - This was my solution before the code review : [click here](https://github.com/Jenin82/hacker-rank-tch/blob/main/hackerrank-in-a-string.js)

## Feedback Summary: 
  - The feedback I received from Amal Shehu suggested that I should refactor my code to improve its readability. Amal recommended using more comments and giving meaningful names to variables. Additionally, he suggested to use recursion instead the for loop to reduce the time complexity of my solution.

## Implementation: 
  - I added more comments explaing every line of my code. 
  - Used recursion to completely remove the for loop.

## Contributors:
  - I would like to extend a special thanks to **Amal Shehu** for his invaluable feedback. He carefully reviewed every line of my code and were able to identify improvements that could enhance code readability and optimization.

## Impact: 
  - After incorporating all the suggested improvements and changes, my code became easier to read and understand without needing further explanation. Additionally, after the refactor, my code became more optimized and faster.
